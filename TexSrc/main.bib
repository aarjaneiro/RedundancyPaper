	abstract = {We consider the issue of task assignment in a distributed system under heavy-tailed (ie. highly variable) workloads. A new adaptable approach called {TAPTF} (Task Assignment based on Prioritising Trafﬁc Flows) is proposed, which improves performance under heavy-tailed workloads for certain classes of trafﬁc. {TAPTF} controls the inﬂux of tasks to each host, enables service differentiation through the use of dual queues and prevents large tasks from unduly delaying small tasks via task migration. Analytical results show that {TAPTF} performs signiﬁcantly better than existing approaches, where task sizes are unknown and tasks are non-preemptive (run-to-completion). As system load increases, the scope and the magnitude of the performance gain expands, exhibiting improvements of more than six times in some cases.},

On the other hand, such exchangeable laws were ﬁrst related to questions from combinatorics in an independent analysis by Fremlin and Talagrand [29], and again more recently in Tao [62], where they appear as a natural proxy for the ‘leading order statistics’ of colourings of large graphs or hypergraphs. Moreover, this relation appears implicitly in the study of various more bespoke formalisms for handling ‘limit objects’ of sequences of dense graphs or hypergraphs in a number of recent works, including Lova´sz and Szegedy [52], Borgs, Chayes, Lova´sz, So´s, Szegedy and Vesztergombi [17], Elek and Szegedy [24] and Razborov [54, 55].

	abstract = {A hypergraph is a set V of vertices and a set of non-empty subsets of V , called hyperedges. Unlike graphs, hypergraphs can capture higher-order interactions in social and communication networks that go beyond a simple union of pairwise relationships. In this paper, we consider the shortest path problem in hypergraphs. We develop two algorithms for ﬁnding and maintaining the shortest hyperpaths in a dynamic network with both weight and topological changes. These two algorithms are the ﬁrst addressing the fully dynamic shortest path problem in a general hypergraph. They complement each other by partitioning the application space based on the nature of the change dynamics and the type of the hypergraph. We analyze the time complexity of the proposed algorithms and perform simulation experiments for both random geometric hypergraphs and the Enron email data set. The latter illustrates the application of the proposed algorithms in social networks for identifying the most important actor based on the closeness centrality metric.},

In the second case an arrived customer chooses one of the servers in accordance with a certain rule and stays in the chosen queue up to the moment of its departure from the system. We define some classes of disciplines and analyze the asymptotical behavior of a multi-server queueing system in a heavy-traffic situation (traffic rate ρ ≥ 1).

Model analysis and comparison with existed methods show that, during the second period we investigated, there exists no obvious volatility regimeswitching, hence combining with regime-switching contributes little to its modeling. Besides, shown by this paper, existence of regime-switching and the transition rate of regime depict the long-term structure of volatility, which could be an intrinsic market property.},

All of this has to do with time averages versus event averages. This is a well understood, but little known topic, called Palm calculus. In this paper we ﬁrst give a very short primer on Palm calculus. Then we apply it to the random waypoint model and variants (with pause time, random walk). We show how to simply obtain the stationary distribution of nodes and speeds, on a connected (possibly non convex) area. We derive a closed form for the density of node location on a square or a disk. We also show how to perform a perfect (i.e. transient free) simulation without computing complicated integrals. Last, we analyze decay and explain it as either convergence to steady state or lack of convergence.},

Recent load balancing strategies often rely on replication or use placeholders to further improve latency. However assessing the performance and stability of these strategies is challenging and is therefore often simulation based. In this paper we introduce a unified approach to analyze the performance and stability of a broad class of workload dependent load balancing strategies. This class includes many replication policies, such as replicate below threshold, delayed replication and replicate only small jobs, as well as strategies for fork-join systems. We consider systems with general job size distributions where jobs may experience server slowdown. We show that the equilibrium workload distribution of the cavity process satisfies a functional differential equation and conjecture that the cavity process captures the limiting behavior of the system as its size tends to infinity. We study this functional differential equation in more detail for a variety of load balancing policies and propose a numerical method to solve it. The numerical method relies on a fixed point iteration or a simple Euler iteration depending on the type of functional differential equation involved. We further show that additional simplifications can be made if certain distributions are assumed to be phase-type. Various numerical examples are included that validate the numerical method and illustrate its strength and flexibility.},

	abstract = {In this paper we investigate the stability and performance of randomized dynamic routing schemes for jobs based on the Join-the-Shortest Queue ({JSQ}) criterion to a heterogeneous system of many parallel servers. In particular we consider servers that use processor sharing but with different server rates and jobs are routed to the server with the smallest occupancy among a ﬁnite number of randomly selected servers. We focus on the case of two servers that is often referred to as a Power-of-Two scheme. We ﬁrst show that in the heterogeneous setting there can be a loss in the stability region over the homogeneous case and thus such randomized schemes need not outperform static randomized schemes in terms of mean delay in opposition to the homogeneous case of equal server speeds where the stability region is maximal and coincides with that of static randomized routing. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the server occupancies and show that the tail distribution of the server occupancy has a super-exponential behavior as in the homogeneous case as the number of servers goes to inﬁnity. To overcome the stability issue, we show that it is possible to combine static state-independent scheme with randomized {JSQ} scheme that allows us to recover the maximal stability region combined with the beneﬁts of {JSQ} and such a scheme is preferable in terms of average delay. The techniques are based on a mean ﬁeld analysis where we show that the stationary distributions coincide with those obtained under asymptotic independence of the servers and moreover the stationary distributions are insensitive to the job size distribution.},

	abstract = {We consider the following natural model: Customers arrive as a Poisson stream of rate lambda n, lambda < 1, at a collection of n servers. Each customer chooses some constant d servers independently and uniformly at random from the n servers and waits for service at the one with the fewest customers. Customers are served according to the first-in first-out (FIFO) protocol and the service time for a customer is exponentially distributed with mean 1. We call this problem the supermarket model. We wish to know how the system behaves and in particular we are interested in the effect that the parameter d has on expected time a customer spends in the system in equilibrium. Our approach uses a limiting, deterministic model representing the behavior as n rightarrow infty to approximate the behavior of finite systems. The analysis of the deterministic model is interesting in its own right. Along with a theoretical justification of this approach, we provide simulations that demonstrate that the method accurately predicts system behavior, even for relatively small systems. Our analysis provides surprising implications: Having d = 2 choices leads to exponential improvements in the expected time a customer spends in the system over d = 1, whereas having d=3 choices is only a constant factor better than d=2. We discuss the possible implications for system design.},
