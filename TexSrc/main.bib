Transm. 32:15–29, 1996), it was shown that when each arriving job is assigned to the shortest of D, D ≥ 2, randomly chosen queues, the equilibrium queue sizes decay doubly exponentially in the limit as N → ∞. This is a substantial improvement over the case D = 1, where queue sizes decay exponentially.},

This generalizes many known models such as power-of-d load balancing and {JSQ} (join the shortest queue) on generic graphs. We provide a generic condition for stability of this model. We show that some graph topologies lead to a loss of capacity, implying more restrictive stability conditions than in, e.g., complete graphs.},

On the other hand, such exchangeable laws were ﬁrst related to questions from combinatorics in an independent analysis by Fremlin and Talagrand [29], and again more recently in Tao [62], where they appear as a natural proxy for the ‘leading order statistics’ of colourings of large graphs or hypergraphs. Moreover, this relation appears implicitly in the study of various more bespoke formalisms for handling ‘limit objects’ of sequences of dense graphs or hypergraphs in a number of recent works, including Lova´sz and Szegedy [52], Borgs, Chayes, Lova´sz, So´s, Szegedy and Vesztergombi [17], Elek and Szegedy [24] and Razborov [54, 55].

    abstract = {Load balancing plays a crucial role in achieving low latency in large distributed systems. Recent load balancing strategies often rely on replication or use placeholders to further improve latency. However assessing the performance and stability of these strategies is challenging and is therefore often simulation based. In this paper we introduce a unified approach to analyze the performance and stability of a broad class of workload dependent load balancing strategies. This class includes many replication policies, such as replicate below threshold, delayed replication and replicate only small jobs, as well as strategies for fork-join systems. We consider systems with general job size distributions where jobs may experience server slowdown. We show that the equilibrium workload distribution of the cavity process satisfies a functional differential equation and conjecture that the cavity process captures the limiting behavior of the system as its size tends to infinity. We study this functional differential equation in more detail for a variety of load balancing policies and propose a numerical method to solve it. The numerical method relies on a fixed point iteration or a simple Euler iteration depending on the type of functional differential equation involved. We further show that additional simplifications can be made if certain distributions are assumed to be phase-type. Various numerical examples are included that validate the numerical method and illustrate its strength and flexibility.},

@article{mukhopadhyay_analysis_nodate,
    title = {Analysis of Randomized Join-The-Shortest-Queue ({JSQ}) Schemes in Large Heterogeneous Processor Sharing Systems},
    abstract = {In this paper we investigate the stability and performance of randomized dynamic routing schemes for jobs based on the Join-the-Shortest Queue ({JSQ}) criterion to a heterogeneous system of many parallel servers. In particular we consider servers that use processor sharing but with different server rates and jobs are routed to the server with the smallest occupancy among a ﬁnite number of randomly selected servers. We focus on the case of two servers that is often referred to as a Power-of-Two scheme. We ﬁrst show that in the heterogeneous setting there can be a loss in the stability region over the homogeneous case and thus such randomized schemes need not outperform static randomized schemes in terms of mean delay in opposition to the homogeneous case of equal server speeds where the stability region is maximal and coincides with that of static randomized routing. We explicitly characterize the stationary distributions of the server occupancies and show that the tail distribution of the server occupancy has a super-exponential behavior as in the homogeneous case as the number of servers goes to inﬁnity. To overcome the stability issue, we show that it is possible to combine static state-independent scheme with randomized {JSQ} scheme that allows us to recover the maximal stability region combined with the beneﬁts of {JSQ} and such a scheme is preferable in terms of average delay. The techniques are based on a mean ﬁeld analysis where we show that the stationary distributions coincide with those obtained under asymptotic independence of the servers and moreover the stationary distributions are insensitive to the job size distribution.},
